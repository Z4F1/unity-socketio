# Unity Socket.io server for my multiplayer game

Still really early for game release. Server is only compatible with windows for now.

## How to run

Run the server.exe to boot up the server. You can type 'help' to get to know the commands.

To be added to the server browser, you need to register your server on the website which is coming soon! Registering your server will not be necessary, because you can connect to a server if you know the ip address. The website will also be used to register new players.

## What is used

The client uses websockets to connect to the servers socket.io. To compile this node.js file into an executable, enclosejs is being used.
